# AI Agents: Your New Coding Partners 🤖

This project wasn't built by a human alone. It was built using **AI Agents**—smart assistants that can write code, run commands, and even browse the web.

## What is an Agent?
Think of an agent like a **tireless junior developer**.
*   It sits in your code editor (like Antigravity).
*   It understands your instructions ("Make this button blue").
*   It can edit multiple files at once.
*   It can *try* to fix its own mistakes.

## Agents We Used
During the creation of this guide, we used several different "brains" (models) to solve problems:

*   **Claude 3.5 Sonnet:** Great for writing code and reasoning.
*   **Gemini 2.0:** Excellent at speed and processing large amounts of information.
*   **Gemini 1.0 Pro:** A solid all-rounder.

## Why Switch Agents?
Sometimes, one agent gets "stuck." It might keep trying the same failed command over and over (like our struggle with `npm install` on Windows).
*   **The Fix:** Switch the model! A new brain brings a new perspective.
*   **The Result:** One model might suggest a complex fix, while another suggests a simple workaround (like "Use WSL").

## How to Work with Agents
1.  **Be Clear:** Treat them like a colleague. "Search online for this error" is better than just pasting the error.
2.  **Be Patient:** They make mistakes. Correct them gently ("That didn't work, try this instead").
3.  **Be the Closer:** Sometimes, you just need to run the final command yourself.
