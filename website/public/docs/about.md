# About This Project 👋

## Created by Prompting

This entire website was created by **[Dominik Lukes](https://dominiklukes.net)** entirely by prompting an AI agent in Antigravity on Windows.

No traditional coding was required. The process involved:
- Describing what was needed in plain English
- Occasional intervention when the agent got stuck
- A few minor direct edits (faster than writing a prompt for small tweaks)

The AI models sometimes made mistakes—including hallucinating URLs that didn't exist. But reminding them to search online or try a different approach always worked.

## How This Page Was Made

This About page was created based on the following prompt:

```
also add an about sectoin - this website was created by Dominik Lukes 
(https://dominiklukes.net) entirely by prompting the agent in antigracity 
on windows - only required occasional intervention and a few minor edits - 
the models did sometimes make a mistake but reminding them to search or 
change something worked. direct editing was only done a few times for 
small tweaks that were faster than writing a prompt
```

That's it. One prompt, and the agent created this page.

## The Workflow

1. **Start with an idea**: "Create a documentation site about Windows AI coding"
2. **Describe features**: "Add a guide about Markdown", "Add an About page"
3. **Fix issues**: "That URL doesn't exist, search for the correct one"
4. **Deploy**: "Push to GitHub and deploy to Cloudflare"

The entire site—including the design, the documentation, the deployment configuration, and this page—was built through conversation.
